# Web-Guesser
Project from http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html
What I learned from this project:
- how to better use github
- how to style inputs
- basics of sinatra
- better grasp of ruby concepts like class variables and instance variables
- better grasp of how to think about creating a project from scratch

What would I do differently if I did this project again?
- be sure to double check my work more often before commiting to github
- check my resources more
